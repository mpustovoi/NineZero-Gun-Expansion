# NineZero's Gun Expansion
NineZero's Gun Expansion (NZGE) is an addon mod for MrCrayfish's Gun Mod that adds additional weapons and attachments in an aesthetically simple style. These weapons are designed and modeled to fit in with the weapons from the Gun Mod, while maintaining key details that help define each weapon.

**All releases on this Github repo are pre-release or alpha builds of the mod. For stable releases, please visit the NZGE CurseForge mod page.**

### Addon Features:
* Over a dozen new weapons to use. By default, these weapons are balanced to fit in with the default CGM weapons.
* One ammo item: the Medium Bullet, used by some of the rifles in this addon.
* An assortment of attachments, including barrels, stocks, sights, and one grip.
* Crafting recipes for all items, allowing them to be used in survival mode.
