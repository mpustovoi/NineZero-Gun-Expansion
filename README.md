# NineZero's Gun Expansion
NineZero's Gun Expansion (NZGE) is an addon mod for MrCrayfish's Gun Mod that adds additional weapons and attachments in an aesthetically simple style. These weapons are designed and modeled to fit in with the weapons from the Gun Mod, while maintaining key details that help define each weapon.

**This is the 1.19.2 development branch, which will not reflect the state of the latest stable build for 1.19.2.** Source code for stable branches of the mod -- including for other versions of Minecraft Java Edition -- can be found in the branch dropdown menu.

All mod releases posted here are development or pre-release builds that are posted to solict feedback regarding upcoming changes or to hunt for bugs/issues before a major update. **For stable releases, please visit the NZGE CurseForge mod page.**

### Addon Features:
* Over a dozen new weapons to use. By default, these weapons are balanced to fit in with the default CGM weapons.
* One ammo item: the Medium Bullet, used by some of the rifles in this addon.
* An assortment of attachments, including barrels, stocks, sights, and one grip.
* Crafting recipes for all items, allowing them to be used in survival mode.
